## Setup and install

#### Dependency installation

1. Download and install [Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for Windows or for Mac.
2. Install Firebase CLI on the command-line with `npm install -g firebase-tools`


#### Project installation and server

```
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

This will then setup all the dependencies we need.

Now simply run this to boot up the server:

```
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```
